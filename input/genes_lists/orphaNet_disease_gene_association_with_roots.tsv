Affected males suffer from true neonatal idiopathic hypoparathyroidism leading to severe hypocalcemia with undetectable parathyroid hormone levels and epilepsy. They are also sterile. Carrier females are normocalcemic and asymptomatic. XLHPT is caused by congenital parathyroid gland agenesis. The XLHPT locus has been mapped to chromosome Xq26-q27, in a 1.5 Mb interval flanked by markers F9 and DXS984.
